This is the last project in Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript module by freeCodeCamp.
Whether it is that or I really enjoyed this project.
It is more practical than majority of other projects, which were quite verbose and involved typing a ton of code only to end up with some UI.
As it turns out I am not so much fond of UI experience. I like to conceptualize what's going on in a program; sort of load half of the job to my brain.
I like the final result that a program produces, much less its interface, functionality etc. Ideally a program for me is when you call it in terminal, give inputs as arguements and get the final result as a file.
Even though this program is user fiendly in that sence, I enjoyed the fact that most of the code added functionality to it, rather than tied hard to justify it.
An anecdote about an electrical engineer trying to fix a car's electrical problems comes to mind. While it is certainly feasible for him to contrive it but at what cost.
He knows totally different algorithms and they don't do him much favor with a car.
That's why all there frameworks came to fruition I guess.
Anywhay, while these projects taught me something about how to get something done. I totally believe that there are frameworks that make such projects a breez.
